# Telecom Growth Strategies: Unlocking Customer Lifetime Value Through Smart Segmentation

## Background and Overview

NexaSat, a telecommunications company established in the competitive telecom sector, faces critical challenges in optimizing marketing strategies and maximizing revenue from their existing customer base. The company's diverse customer portfolio ranges from occasional users to loyal high-value customers, creating inefficiencies in their current one-size-fits-all engagement approach.

With intensifying market competition, NexaSat recognized the urgent need to implement data-driven customer segmentation to:

- Identify high-value customer segments for targeted marketing
- Optimize resource allocation for up-selling and cross-selling initiatives
- Maximize Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) through personalized offerings
- Reduce customer churn through strategic retention programs

This project delivers a comprehensive Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) segmentation analysis using advanced SQL techniques to unlock actionable insights from NexaSat's customer data from July 2023.

### Key Analysis Areas:

- Customer lifetime value calculation and scoring
- Behavioral segmentation based on usage patterns
- Revenue optimization through targeted recommendations
- Cross-selling and up-selling opportunity identification
